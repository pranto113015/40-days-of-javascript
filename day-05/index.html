     <h2>Differences between for, while, and do-while loop</h2>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>For Loop:</strong> The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.</li>

         <li><strong>While Loop:</strong> The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known. It continues to execute as long as the specified condition is true.</li>
         <img src="./img/while_loop_workflow.png" alt="while_loop_workflow">
         <li><strong>Do-While Loop:</strong> The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.</li>
